            <p>Back in <b className="text-black dark:text-[#B8B8B8]">2020</b>, I started learning web development by creating simple websites using <b className="text-black dark:text-[#B8B8B8]">HTML</b>, <b className="text-black dark:text-[#B8B8B8]">CSS</b>, and <b className="text-black dark:text-[#B8B8B8]">JavaScript</b>. This sparked my passion for coding and led me to explore more. 🚀 </p>

            <p>I began my experience by creating websites and building landing pages using <b className="text-black dark:text-[#B8B8B8]">WordPress</b> for local businesses and completing several projects for my web programming courses at university. I also enjoy diving into back-end development with <b className="text-black dark:text-[#B8B8B8]">Node.js</b> and <b className="text-black dark:text-[#B8B8B8]">PHP</b>. 💻 These experiences have helped me build a solid foundation in web development. 🏗️
            </p>

            <p>These days, my main focus is creating <b className="text-black dark:text-[#B8B8B8]">user-friendly</b> and <b className="text-black dark:text-[#B8B8B8]">accessible</b> web applications. I love working with <b className="text-black dark:text-[#B8B8B8]">React</b> and <b className="text-black dark:text-[#B8B8B8]">Next.js</b>, finding that sweet spot where design meets functionality. I’m passionate about writing <b className="text-black dark:text-[#B8B8B8]">clean code</b> that is easy to understand and maintain. 🌐 In my free time, I enjoy working on side projects. Recently, I've been developing a web app using <b className="text-black dark:text-[#B8B8B8]">Firebase</b>, which has been a great learning experience. 📚
